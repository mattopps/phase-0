3 - Design
4 - Development
5 - Testing

Q: What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

A: It will share some personal details like who I am, what I am/have been doing and a link to my blog. 

Q: What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

A: Interests would be learning about development or job search/networking related goals.


Q: What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

Users should read my bio, look at my portfolio, and contact me to discuss those things.

Q: What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

A: Design and UX are not inherently the same thing though UX can be considered an aspect of design. Design is about creating a site to look a certain way and work a certain way whereas UX is about how a user feels while going through the process of using the site or any of its parts.

Q: What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 

A: UX design is the enterprise of studying the emotional reaction of users using a site. It can drastically and significantly affect the success of the site as a whole or of a particular function of the site. If the site is commerce related it would be of paramount importance that users didn't hate buying things on the site.

Q: Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

A: None per se. But I  am still having some trouble with my repos and branches and try to delete branches and I can't. Adjacent to this challenge.
