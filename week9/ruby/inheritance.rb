# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].


# Pseudocode
assign a Cohort a name, and start,immersive, and graduation dates
 - create a list of all students and their emails
  - create a tally of all students in a Cohort

- create a sublist of names, emails, tally of LocalCohort
  -add a specific city to a LocalCohort
   -city, students, cohortname, phase0 start date, immersive start date, grad date, email list, num of students
   --add_student, remove_student, currently_in_phase, graduated?



# Initial Solution

class GlobalCohort
  def initialize()
  end

end

class LocalCohort > GlobalCohort
  def initialize()
  end

end
