Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
-Now I'm confused. Wasn't this part of the prior reflection?
Assuming this doesn't include any prliminary steps to setting up a github account (setting up wifi, connecting to the internet, download chrome, setup github) click on the '+' symbol in the top right corner and click on 'New Repository' and then click on your account name in the pop up. In the bottom right there will be a little clipboard. click on it. (assuming a mac in use) Click on the magnifying class icon on the top right corner of your desktop. type in "terminal". click on the icon of the black square. click inside the black square that opens. type "git clone" and then paste. Hit enter.
Describe what open source means.
-Nobody owns the copyrights. The code is open to whomever wants to use it so long as they maintain the same level of open utility.
What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
-I haven't given it enough thought yet to form a coherent opinion. Likely I will think partially in both directions.
Assess the importance of using licenses.
-Licenses allow others to use your code/program according to the specifications of the license. Even if there is intent to allow it to be used openly by anyone it is a good idea to license it as such rather than simply releasing your work publicly and relinquishing any rights.
What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
-SOOOOOOO much struggle. I'm pretty sure that my githup repos are a mess. the first 10 times that I tried to switch from the branch to master and pull I got errors. the week-1 directories that I made and the md files saved in them disappeared. I would go to finder and open the files and thjey wouldnt be there. then ten minutes later they might be. Sometimes if i went back up a level in the directory I stopped getting the errors other times not. 
Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it. 
-Not yet.
