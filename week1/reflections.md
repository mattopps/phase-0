# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

In thinking about time I realized a few things about my learning processes. Firstly I know that I don't yet know the answers to some of these issues but will have to reevaluate them over the next few weeks. I don't yet know when/where/how I learn best. For example, I generally work well late at night, but this is a chicken/egg issue of being up late in the first place. I know too much or too little noise is distracting and I attempt to solve this problem with music in headphones. But it is probable that much of the music I listen to isn't helping, and the process of selecting new songs is distracting.
The most important step I took was even before this section of the course was that I downloaded a chrome extension to allow me to manipulate the speed of videos. I know that I get very bored watching long videos that explain things. It seems that in almost every case people talk slower than they need to and so I feel that time is wasted and it is frustrating to me and it can derail the whole enterprise because I am constantly thinking about how much other material I can not cover in later hours during the day.
Speeding up these videos solves these problems. I can adjust the speed to minimize the time it takes to play the video at a coherent and penetrating pace. Having the videos play at a faster clip is engaging as it forces me to focus more on the video because of the sense that I might miss something if I am not engaged.
This hits the challenging aspect mentioned in FLOW.
great segue. I liked the flow concept but all the articles about it seemed tautological to me. They advised doing what as both means and end eg. 'if you want to run fast , focus on running fast. '
I like the Timebox methods because of the structure and feedback built in.
Until now I have not had great time management skills. I find it very hard to estimate how long a project will take and I frequently plan for non specific time related intervals IE I plan to accomplish things after lunch before the football game. which is kind of like saying between 3 pm and 8 pm, but not really. This approach doesn't grant the importance of a primary task to the project  
Going forward I plan on establishing set intervals for working in with an alarm followed by short times set for reflection  and feedback. So far I have definitely not adhered to a sensible schedule for this first week.


## 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

I learned a lot of the basics commands for the command line. I learned that a bash is a command line interface and is a type of shell. I had thought they were pretty much synonymous but it turns out that GUIs are also shells. I learned that my 'd' key seems to be sticking and it was pretty frustrating trying to mkdir without a 'd'.
At first I was a little nervous because the video tutorial was over my head. I was expecting it to be only basic commands like touch, mkdir, cd, pwd, ls, which I had done before. I'm still having a hard time wrapping my head around the mv command because my understanding is that it changes the name of a file but keeps it's path the same. I thought the obvious thing is that it moved a file to a different directory. Still don't know how to do that after using apropos a bunch. 'Till next time.
I think they'e all very useful. pwd,ls,cd maybe the most.
-pwd - shows what directory you are in
-ls - lists the contents of the directory
-mv - renames a file/directory
-cd - changes to a different directory
-../ - no idea. 
-touch  - creates a file
-mkdir - creates a new directory
-less - displays text and lets you page through
-rmdir - deletes an empty directory
-rm - deletes a file
-help - prints a list of things bash can do

### 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection  

My instructions would almost definitely be based on the ones i was given. If it ain't broke ...
The visual aids above were perfect. I would say - look for the  '+' symbol next to the alarm bell at the top right of the page , click on it and then click 'create new repository'. Once the page loads click on the 'Fork' button and then click on your account in the box that pops up. Find the little clipboard icon at the bottom right of the page. If it doesn't say HTTPS clone above the clipboard icon, then click on the HTTPS link below the clipboard icon. then click on the clipboard icon. You just copied the link in the window next to the clipboard which links to this repository. 
Open a bash shell. Navigate to whatever directory you want to store the repo in. type $git clone and then paste in the link that you copied.
If you are doing work based off of any other work, or file, or instructions then there should be some existing master branch to fork. It would only make sense to create your own repository if you are doing your own original work.
I set up github before I applied to DBC and I don't remember much about the setup process. I definitely didn't know how to delete a forked repo until today. There was one time that I was trying to solve a simple coding challenge and got very confused by the fact that you can only fork a repo once. I had messed up something with the commits and I was trying to start over.Or I was trying to undo a pull request or something. 
I got into the habit of forking, cloning, adding, committing, checking status, and pushing without ever learning any of the other features of the site. I learned that I need to improve my typing skills and custom save typing shortcuts and better understand the different ways you can modify a command with a '-' like cmd -m instead of just  cmd.
