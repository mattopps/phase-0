    <h1> Summary </h1>

      <p>Welcome to HTML Anatomy 101. In this class, you will do the learn how to dissect an HTML page from the &lt;head&gt; to the &lt;footer&gt;, add a new feature to Sublime Text, and mark up your previous blog posts with semantic HTML tags. So get your gloves on, open your textbook (the <a href="#">HTML docs</a>) and begin!</p>

    <h1> Release 0: Set up </h1>

      <p>Decide who will drive and who will navigate. Then each of you will need to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Create a feature branch in the phase-0 directory</li>
        <li>Using the command line, navigate to the week-3 directory</li>
        <li>Within that directory, (using the command line) create a blank HTML page called dissect-me.html.</li>
        <li>Add, commit, and push your changes to GitHub. Create a quick pull request and merge the changes. </li>
        <li>SUBMIT your link to the dissect-me.html file as soon as you do this. This is how your guide will give you feedback. The URL should be something like: <a href="#">https://github.com/[USERNAME]/phase-0/blob/master/week-3/dissect-me.html </a></li>
      </ul>
        <p>NOTE: You should decide whether to trade roles in each release or change roles halfway through the session. If you decide to switch from release to release, you'll want to share code easily using a collaborative editor (or even a simple Google doc).</p>

<!-- 
Q: What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

A:<html>,<head><title><body> are requirements for every page.
<ul>,<li><p> are very very common for displaying text
<a href> for links, which are also common

Q:How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

A: In order from top to bottom. Usually the browser loads it as written top to bottom. Links and external sources can vary by browser and connection.

Q: What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

A: I learned that Sublime is awesome. And I will definitely be using snippets. I love them. There's no telling what we can do with them. I will definitely be reading up on sublimetext.info. I just found out that F6 is spellcheck. (though there are some false negatives. 'html' and 'li' are not words they are html tags. oh well)
