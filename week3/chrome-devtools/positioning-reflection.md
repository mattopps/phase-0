Q: How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

A: Devtools allows you see how your css changes and display them in real time. 

Q: How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

A: Click on any element in the html pane and it will show the corresponding css selector styling in the pane on the right. in the css pane on the right you can add any options that you want and see how they affect the page elements in real time. Height, Width, and padding are great to cheange the size and shape of an element.

Q: What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

A: 
-Static position is the default browser setting. 
-Fixed locks in the element in the spot on the page regardless of the user scrolling up or down on the page.
-Absolute positioning places the element on the page according its characteristics regardless of the effects or positioning of other elements on the page.
-Relative positioning 

Fixed was easiest to use because it has obvious immediate results. I found the absolute and relative positioning confusing. Initially, when I alternated back and forth between them I didn't see any difference in the page at all. After a while the only difference I saw was in the case that multiple elements occupied the same space. Still a lot to learn about those two.

Q: What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?

A: Margin is the space between the element and another element.
padding is the space between the text/content of the element and the border of the element
the border is a visual demarcation surrounding the element

Q: What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)

A:This was a solid challenge. I think it might have been good to do this one before 3.3. Still a lot of concepts that need reinforcing but I actually learned some stuff and was able to put into practice.
