# Pseudocode
1 - write a method to create consecutive fibonacci numbers
2 -every loop adding the next sequence of the fibonacci test to see if you can subtract that fibonacci number from the test number and get 0.
continue to the nexxt loop if you subtract the current fibonacci from the test number and get anything but 0. 
# Initial Solution

def is_fibonacci?(num)
	
	while i < 1000	   
	    #code to get the next fib number one at a time
	    #
	    #
	    return true if num - fib ==0 
	    return false if num - fib < 0
	    i += 1
	   end
end
